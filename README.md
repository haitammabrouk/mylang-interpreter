# Simple interpreter in Go

This project is a simple interpreter written in Go, inspired by the book Thorsten Ball's Book. The goal of this project is to demystify the world of compilers and interpreters by providing a hands-on approach to building one.

## Overview

This interpreter consists of three main components: lexer, parser, and evaluator.

## Features

- **Integer** : Numeric literals.
- **Identifiers**: Variable names.
- **Operators**: +, -, *, /, %, <, >, <=, >= , ==, !=
- **Parentheses**: '(' and ')'.
- **Braces**: '{' and '}'.
- **Keywords**: if, else, let, fn, true, false, return , null ...

## Usage

To run the lexer:

```bash
go run main.go

The Work is not completed yet i'm planning to work on the parser part
